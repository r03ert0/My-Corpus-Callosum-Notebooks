My Corpus Callosum Notebooks
============================

A place for my iPython notebooks.


1. Simulation of the effects of brain volume control strategies
---------------------------------------------------------------

These notebooks describe simulations of the effect of three different strategies to control for mean brain volume between two populations when studying another trait (here, corpus callosum size) that correlates with brain volume.

**Notebooks:**

1. Effect of using CC normalised by BV.ipynb
2. Effect of using BV as covariate.ipynb
3. Effect of IQ Matching.ipynb
