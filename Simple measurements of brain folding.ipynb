      "# Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Brain folding is an important neuroanatomical phenotype, related to brain evolution, development and neuropathology. The degree of neocortical folding correlates strongly with total brain volume. Whereas the neocortex of small mammals such as mice, shrews and squirrels is smooth (lissencephalic), the neocortex of large mammals such as humans and dolphins is profusely folded (gyrencephalic). During development the neocortex is initially smooth and undifferentiated. In gyrencephalic mammals, the time of the formation of cortical folds corresponds with the time of the greatest neocortical expansion, the development of cytoarchitectonic fields and cortico-cortical connectivity. Several neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders present with characteristic abnormalities in cortical folding. Defects in neurogenesis and neuronal migration can lead to lissencephaly of microgyri: the pathological absence or overabundance of neocortical folding. Finally, more subtle variations in the degree of neocortical folding have been reported in several neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Brain folding is easy to observe and measure. The resolution provided by clinical structural magnetic resonance images (MRI) is sufficient to measure brain folding accurately, and despite the sensibility of these measurements to the site-specific acquisition parametres, structural MRI remains the most easily comparable brain imaging sequence in multi-centric studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several indices of brain folding have been proposed through the years. Zilles, Luders, Van Essen, Schaer, Germanaud. Many of them share a common limitation: they are unable to distinguish between a brain with few deep folds and a brain with many superficial ones. Methods based on a spectral decomposition, such as Germanaud, are able to overcome this limitation. When analysing brains with exactly the same number of fold but of different depth these methods will only produce different histograms of eigenvalues, whose interpretation in terms of number and depth of folds is unclear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here we start by introducing several simple, global, measurements to understand and measure the relationship between cortical surface area, gyral length, gyral depth, and the total length of folds. Next, we define local versions of all these measurements. Finally, we show how these measurements are distributed and related in neocortical surface reconstructions from the open-access dataset XXXX. We have made available Freesurfer-compatible, open-source implementations of these measurements on github: http://github.com/neuroanatomia/brainfolding."

      "The absolute folding index $F$ suffers from the same issue of indices based on a ratio of surfaces: it cannot distinguish between a surface with few deep folds and a surface with many superficial ones. Several alternative methods have been proposed in the past to provide an idea of the frequency of folding, and to then disentangle sulcal depth and abundance. Among these methods are, for example, those based on spectral decompositions of surface shape, using for example spherical harmonics (REF: Machin) or an eigen decomposition of the Laplace-Beltrami operator of the surface (REF: Germanaud et al) or analyses of curvature (REF: Luders, Van Essen). Whereas these methods allow one to effectively differentiate sulcal depth and abundance, the values they produce are not easy to interprete.\n",

If the reconstruction is irregular, there may be many changes changes in curvature which will produce spurious edges.

      "For a folded surface, the folding perimeter will increase depending on the number of folds present, but independently of their depth. In other words, two surfaces with the same number of folds but of different depth may have the same folding perimeter $P$. These could be distinguished, however, based on their absolute folding index $F$, which will be larger in case of the surface with more folds. Ideally, however, one would like to have direct measurements of the length, width and depth of each gyrus and sulcus. But even if the idea of folding width and sulcal depth seems straightforward, measuring it in practice is hard to do automatically and time-consuming to do manually. Even more, there are many cases where it is not clear what the width of a gyrus is. For example, how do we measure the width of the region where a gyrus branches into two gyri? Or how do we measure the depth of a sulcus within the insula? Relative to the external lateral surface or relative to the local gyral crowns? Here we will see that we can, however, combine folding perimeter and absolute folding to provide global estimations of the folding width and depth (later we will also obtain local estimations).\n",

If the folds were very shallow, we could approximate folding width by $W_1=S/L_1$. If we approximate the lissencephalic reference of our brain by a sphere, then the folding index $F$ quantifies the surface excess relative to the sphere.

As the brain matures and folds become deeper, opposite gyral walls tend to approach one another, gyral crowns flatten (likely because of the contact with the skull), and folds acquire a more flat, squared shape. The previous equation for $D$ supposes a fold with a squared profile, it is a lower limit for folding depth, and will especially under-estimate the depth of folds with an immature shape. An upper boundary for fold depth can be obtained by supposing a triangular profile, and then that\n",
